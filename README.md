# GeminiSensei (The Academic Practitioner)

**GeminiSensei** is a desktop-native AI Engineering Lead that enforces rigorous computer science education. Unlike passive chatbots that simply answer questions, GeminiSensei actively manages a student's development using a "Strict Protocol Loop."

It refuses to hallucinate (by mandating live Google Search verification), refuses to spoon-feed code (enforcing strict Spec-First development), and actively blocks progress using "Gatekeeping" logic until specific theoretical foundations are proven. It is not just a tutor; it is a Guardian of Code Quality.
